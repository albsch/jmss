JMSS is a minimal zero-dependency efficient SAT solver.

This work is based on the system defined by Sava Krstic and Amit Goel, 'Architecting Solvers for SAT Modulo Theories: Nelson-Oppen with DPLL' (2007).

# JMSS - Usage

Download a runnable JAR form a tagged release.

Execute

```
   java -jar jmss-1.0.0.jar
```

for console help and usable modules. 


# JMSS - Exporter & Monitoring

If `jmss-exporter` is used instead of the `jmss` runnable jar, then metrics are exported at port `8004`.
These metrics can be used with the provided Prometheus and Grafana Docker setup:
